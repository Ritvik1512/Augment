# Augment
Augment was my first Augmented Reality project using AS3 and self-customized libraries of PaperVision 3D.

This is projects is probably deparcated now, since this was built on the software of 2012-13 and the libraries are deparcated as well. Surely
this project is a great source of inspiration for me.
